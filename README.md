# toy_assembly
A toy "assembly" language built in Python with simple memory allocation commands that run on mock memory and mock registers. This is a line by line language and always begins with an action word. Memory addresses are represented by rowxcol eg. 0x0 for the first bit. This language is not a serious language and only serves for a bit of learning and fun!

Note: Registers should always output as an empty array - all operations utilize the registers temporarily and insert results into memory
